# Library Management System

This is a simple Java-based library management system that allows users to perform basic operations such as adding a new book, removing a book, borrowing a book, returning a book, and searching for books by title or author.

## Overview

The program consists of two main classes:
- **Book**: Represents a book with attributes such as title, author, ISBN, genre, and availability status.
- **Library**: Manages a collection of books and includes methods to perform operations like adding, removing, searching, borrowing, and returning books.

## Instructions to Run the Program

### Prerequisites:
- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.

### Steps to Run the Program:

1. **Download the provided Java file:**
   - Copy the entire Java code provided.
   - Paste it into a text file named `LibraryManagementSystem.java`.

2. **Save the file:**
   - Save the `LibraryManagementSystem.java` file in a directory of your choice on your local system.

3. **Create or locate the data file:**
   - Create a text file named `library_data.txt` in the same directory where you saved the `LibraryManagementSystem.java` file.
   - This file will be used to store the updates made to the library (e.g., adding, removing, borrowing, and returning books).

4. **Open a terminal or command prompt:**
   - On Windows: Press `Win + R`, type `cmd`, and press Enter.
   - On macOS: Press `Cmd + Space`, type `Terminal`, and press Enter.
   - On Linux: Press `Ctrl + Alt + T`.

5. **Navigate to the directory containing the Java file:**
   - Use the `cd` command to navigate to the directory where you saved the `LibraryManagementSystem.java` file.
   - For example, if you saved the file on your desktop, you can navigate to it using:
     ```
     cd Desktop
     ```

6. **Compile the Java file:**
   - Type the following command and press Enter to compile the Java file:
     ```
     javac LibraryManagementSystem.java
     ```
   - This command compiles the Java source code and generates a bytecode file named `LibraryManagementSystem.class`.

7. **Run the compiled program:**
   - Once the compilation is successful, run the compiled program using the following command:
     ```
     java LibraryManagementSystem
     ```
   - This command executes the `LibraryManagementSystem` class, launching the library management system application in the command-line interface.

8. **Interact with the program:**
   - Follow the prompts in the command-line interface to add, remove, search for, borrow, and return books, as well as save and load data to/from the `library_data.txt` file.

9. **Exit the program:**
   - To exit the program, select the "Exit" option from the menu.
   - Alternatively, you can press `Ctrl + C` in the terminal/command prompt to terminate the program at any time.
